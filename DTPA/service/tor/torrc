#############################################################################
#	CODE ERRORS: 							    #
#	This torrc file contains 'some' code that is causing a fatal error  #
#	when the container starts. Probably `SOCKSPORT 0.0.0.0:9050` as this#
#	line is displayed in the docker log for the container when it starts#
#	or a user connects to the container. If this is not the cause of the#
#	error then the probable cause is the privoxy config settings which  #
#	otherwise throw an unrecoverable error (possibly by binding to      #
#	SOCKSPORT 0.0.0.0:9050 before tor can) 				    #
# 									    #
#############################################################################


## Tor opens a SOCKS proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
## configure one below. Set "SOCKSPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only
## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
#SOCKSPort 192.168.0.1:9100 # Bind to this address:port too.

SOCKSPort 0.0.0.0:9050 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.


## Uncomment this to start the process in the background... or use
## --runasdaemon 1 on the command line. This is ignored on Windows;
## see the FAQ entry if you want Tor to run as an NT service.
#RunAsDaemon 1

############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###

## Once you have configured a hidden service, you can look at the
## contents of the file ".../hidden_service/hostname" for the address
## to tell people.
##
## HiddenServicePort x y:z says to redirect requests on port x to the
## address y:z.

#HiddenServiceDir @LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/tor/hidden_service/
#HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80

#HiddenServiceDir @LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/tor/other_hidden_service/
#HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
#HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22

## A handle for your relay, so people don't have to refer to it by key.
## Nicknames must be between 1 and 19 characters inclusive, and must
## contain only the characters [a-zA-Z0-9].
## If not set, "Unnamed" will be used.
Nickname docktor


## Uncomment this if you do *not* want your relay to allow any exit traffic.
## (Relays allow exit traffic by default.)
#ExitRelay 0

#Work out how to correctly use this option to act as a https proxy also. May not be necessary as Tor can handle SOCKS5 traffic from Privoxy
HTTPSProxy 0.0.0.0:2177
