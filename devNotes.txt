To complete:

Linuxtordocker
	-Networking between containers needs to be set up between containers
	-systemPrepare.bin needs finishing
		-Script must launch tor container then {wait} for the process to finish and launch NGINX (probably in that order for reverse proxy to work)
	-imageBuild needs fixing, I think errors are being caused by the variables used
	-namespaceObfsc.bin requires finishing so the namespaces of each process are isolated from the remainder of the system namespaces, this mitigates security risks related to container breakout.
	-Memory container add-on (Redis?)
	-versions of tor, privoxy and NGINX should self verify
	-add in automatic versioning
	-Lisences
	-Network diagram

================================================================================================
Tor
	-torrc - Needs configuring correctly to handle traffic remotely through privoxy
	-torrc also requires editing to handle forwarding correctly

Privoxy
	-Translate http >> SOCKS5 traffic
		-edit config file

NGINX
	-Reverse proxy settings need tying into docker bridges
	-Need to consider adding SOCKS5 support (not necessary though)
	-Turn off content cacheing
	-set up file handling for memory expansion

Redis
	-Investigate useability of Redis for memory support module and possible method of transfering memory
	-Investigate security of using Redis to store items in non-contigeous memory, possible issue relating to memory addresses?
